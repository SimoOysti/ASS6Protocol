Introduction

ASS6 is a protocol used for keeping a server-sided TODO-list which clients can modify remotely

ASS6 will use the port 1338 by default and transfer data as plain text.

**************
Request syntax

Example responses:
------------------

ASS6_V1 LIST 2 1) Vaccuum the lawn\n2) Buy butter\n\r\n
ASS6_V1 ADDED 3 Buy milk\r\n
ASS6_V1 REMOVED 3 Buy milk\r\n
ASS6_V1 ERROR ASS6InvalidID Server was unable to find a task with the ID specified in the DONE request.\r\n


Error codes:
------------

- ASS6InvalidID
  Server was unable to find a task with the ID specified in the DONE request.

- ASS6InvalidRequest
  The client sent a request using invalid syntax that the server failed to parse.

- ASS6FileNotAccessible
  Server had a problem when trying to access the to-do list file.

- ASS6UnsupportedProtocol
  Server does not support the protocol which was specified by the client in the request.

If a connection error occurs while processing a request, the client will not receive any response.
Therefore the client should handle connection problems by utilizing a timeout.
